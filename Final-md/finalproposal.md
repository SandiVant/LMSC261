### Final Project Proposal
Cassandra Sturdivant

# Description of the deliverable-

I will be creating a calculator, a complex tool allowing user input to quickly generate a useful output. Using Javascript.

# What problem does the project solve?

The objective would be to improve workflow.

# What resources will you use? (specific links to others' code)

I will be using [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvQX6k8iqs] and [https://playcode.io/empty] to run the code itself.

# What are the use cases? (who is your ‘audience’?)

My audience would be directed to anyone who needs to be able to solve basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Timeline
Each week I would do extensive research on how the code is working. I am assuming this occurs within 4 weeks. For the first week I would look. Into CSS, the second week HTML, the third week the javascript code, and the fourth week the presentation.

# How do you think you should be assessed?
I think I should be assessed when actually running the code. Am I able to use playcode? Are there other ways to run this code that you would prefer?
