### Final Project Proposal
Cassandra Sturdivant

# Description of the deliverable-

My vision is to create a playable 25-88 key, keyboard using javascript.

# What problem does the project solve?

The objective of my project is to be able to construct simple melodic melodies and harmonies if possible.

# What resources will you use? (specific links to others' code)

The website I have decided to use to assist me in completing this project are:

# What are the use cases? (who is your ‘audience’?)

My audience is directed to anybody who wants to find a quick way to check pitch, construct melodies, or just for personal use.

# Timeline
Each week I would do extensive research on how the code is working. I am assuming this occurs within 4 weeks. For the first week I would look. Into, javascript the second week HTML, the third week the css, and in the forth week have my project ready to present with all of the factors constructed performance ready.

# How do you think you should be assessed?
I think I should be assessed just when I run into basic problems, however I will try to resolve the problem before asking for help. The main way I believe I would need to be assisted would be in running the code. I am able to run it in playcode to see if it works well. But I want to run it from my laptop. I am just confused on how to run css, html, and javascript all at once without using a 3rd part website.
