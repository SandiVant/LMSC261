# Foursquare
### Cassandra Sturdivant

I give all my credit to Nicolette she send me the code I won't take credit for anything. I could not figure it out the farthest i got was this website that was not helpful really.

[https://www.codevscolor.com/python-print-star-hollow-square-pattern/]

However I wrote all of the code out by hand myself and I am not sure what i did wrong because it is not running through terminal.

I understand how the code works though, i read through it and I believe what is going on is that each line is being printed individually rather than a code that runs the whole square.

I tried to even rewrite the code and try to run it in terminal and it still wouldn't work.
