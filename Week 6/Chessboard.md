## Chessboard

I had NO CLUE what I was doing. However, I was able to find the code under this website [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30225678/how-do-i-solve-the-eloquent-javascript-chess-board/30225774]

I the put the code in atom and ran it through terminal using the node software.

Luckily it worked so I am a happy camper.
