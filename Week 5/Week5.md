# JavaScript

I went to a tutor because I was absent. I was bale to construct the code within an hour. I downloaded node software so I am able to fun javascript in terminal. I then ran the code in terminal and it was bale to work.

Let number = 1 meaning starting at 1.

number = number + 1 meaning, each line goes up in value by 1.

number <= 100 meaning up to 100

And I put number % 15 == 0 before the rest of the code so that if a number is divisible by 5 and 3 it will see 15 first. Then check for the rest.
