#H1 Scratch Details

H4 What I added:
Loop, for the bouncing ball.
Variables, for the "I think I'm glitching"


####H4
This project was fun, it took me a while to figure out a system that would not end up not being stuck. After going through all the variables I was able to create something original.

I did not use anyone else's code, but I did use your variable as an example.
